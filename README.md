# MapBox

In this challenge I utilized a local Python server, and HTML file and a few JavaScript files to create an earthquake map with navigable filters. I also created a map that could show the locations of tectonic plates on earth, another to show earthquakes above magnitude 4.5, and finally I added a dark-layered map.
